# North pool detail pilot (task `north-pool-detail-pilot`)

Dave, 31 October 2026: start with one well-mapped, well-photographed area and take
it as far as it will go. The north pool has the most references, three solved
cameras (IMG_2204-2206), laser-survey levels and the Blender facade-kit pilot.

## Baseline (before)

`IMG_2204-before.png` to `IMG_2208-before.png`, rendered with Details on through
each photo's camera (`scripts/shoot_views.cjs IMG_2204 ... --pose --details
--task=north-pool-detail-pilot --as=before`), after the `pool-detail` work.
IMG_2207 and IMG_2208 are not solved yet and render from their starting poses,
which look far past the roof tiles in the photos; solving them is part of the pilot.

What the baseline shows against the photos:
- Plaster walls are flat white with no weathering; roofs and parapets are plain.
- Barrel roof tiles in the foreground of IMG_2205-2208 are flat orange slabs.
- Planting is painted cards: the Strelitzia clumps read, but the clipped hedges,
  bougainvillea and the yucca/dracaena by the east wall are much less detailed.
- The crazy-paving path round the lawn and the terracotta patios are plain fills.
- The lawn is a flat even green; the photos show worn patches and edging.
- The distant backdrop is a painted band; the photos show trees and mountains.

## Increments

1. Photo-matched surfaces: plaster, crazy paving, terracotta, barrel roof tiles.
2. 3D planting where the photos show it.
3. Pool details built in Blender, with the deck outline (`pool-deck-outline`).
4. Google satellite and photorealistic 3D tiles as further comparison views,

Each increment adds `-after` renders through the same cameras.
